        The "Flying Spaghetti Monster" was first described in a satirical open
        letter written by Bobby Henderson in 2005 to protest the Kansas State
        Board of Education decision to permit teaching intelligent design as an
        alternative to evolution in public school science classes. In the
        letter, Henderson demanded equal time in science classrooms for "Flying
        Spaghetti Monsterism", alongside intelligent design and evolution. After
        Henderson published the letter on his website, the Flying Spaghetti
        Monster rapidly became an Internet phenomenon and a symbol of opposition
        to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools.
